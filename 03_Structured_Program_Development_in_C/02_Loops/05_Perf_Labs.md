(Printing Numbers from a Loop) Write a program that utilizes looping to print the numbers from 1 to 10 side by side
on the same line with three spaces between numbers.

 (Find the Largest Number) The process of finding the largest number (i.e., the maximum of a group of numbers)
 is used frequently in computer applications. For example, a program that determines the winner of a sales 
 contest would input the number of units sold by each salesperson. The salesperson who sells the most units 
 wins the contest. Write a pseudocode program and then a program that inputs a series of 10 non-negative numbers
 and determines and prints the largest of the numbers. Hint: Your program should use three variables as follows:

```
counter:	A counter to count to 10 (i.e., to keep track of how many numbers have
been input and to determine when all 10 numbers have been processed)

number:	The current number input to the program

largest:	The largest number found so far
```
(Validating User Input) Modify the program below to validate its inputs. On any input, 
if the value entered is other than 1 or 2, keep looping until the user enters a correct value.

What does the following program print?

(Square of Asterisks) Write a program that reads in the side of a square and then 
prints that square out of asterisks. Your program should work for squares of all side
sizes between 1 and 20. For example, if your program reads a size of 4, it should print

```
****
****
****
****
```
(Hollow Square of Asterisks) Modify the program you wrote previously so that
it prints a hollow square. For example, if your program reads a size of 5, it should print

```
*****
*   *
*   *
*   *
*****
```

(Interest Calculator) The simple interest on a loan is calculated by the formula
```
 interest = principal * rate * days / 365;
```
The preceding formula assumes that rate is the annual interest rate, and therefore 
includes the division by 365 (days). Develop a program that will input principal, 
rate and days for several loans, and will calculate and display the simple interest for each loan, 
using the preceding formula. Here is a sample input/output dialog:


```
Enter loan principal (-1 to end): 1000.00
Enter interest rate: .1
Enter term of the loan in days: 365
The interest charge is $100.00

Enter loan principal (-1 to end): 1000.00
Enter interest rate: .08375
Enter term of the loan in days: 224
The interest charge is $51.40

Enter loan principal (-1 to end): -1

```

(Salary Calculator) Develop a program that will determine the gross pay for each of
several employees. The company pays “straight time” for the first 40 hours worked by 
each employee and pays “time-and-a-half” for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours. 
You’re given a list of the employees of the company, the number of hours each employee 
worked last week and the hourly rate of each employee. Your program should input this 
information for each employee and should determine and display the employee’s gross pay. 
Here is a sample input/output dialog:

```

Enter # of hours worked (-1 to end): 39
Enter hourly rate of the worker ($00.00): 10.00
Salary is $390.00

Enter # of hours worked (-1 to end): 40
Enter hourly rate of the worker ($00.00): 10.00
Salary is $400.00

Enter # of hours worked (-1 to end): 41
Enter hourly rate of the worker ($00.00): 10.00
Salary is $415.00

Enter # of hours worked (-1 to end): -1

```
