# Introduction to C
C is a high-level structured oriented programming language, used in general purpose programming, developed by Dennis Ritchie at AT&T Bell Labs, the USA between 1969 and 1973.

## Concise Facts about the C Programming Language
* In 1988, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) had formalized the C language.
* C was invented to write UNIX operating system.
* C is a successor of 'Basic Combined Programming Language' (BCPL) called B language.
* Linux OS, PHP, and MySQL are written in C.
* C has been written in assembly language.

## The Uses of the C Programming Language

In the beginning, C was used for developing system applications, e.g. :
```
* Database Systems
* Language Interpreters
* Compilers and Assemblers
* Operating Systems
* Network Drivers
* Word Processors

```
## The Popularity of C for Various Reasons
* One of the early programming languages.
* Still, the best programming language to learn quickly.
* C language is reliable, simple and easy to use.
* C language is a structured language.
* Modern programming concepts are based on C.
* It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms.
* Universities preferred to add C programming in their courseware.

## Features os C Programming Language
* C is a robust language with a rich set of built-in functions and operators.
* Programs written in C are efficient and fast.
* C is highly portable, programs once written in C can be run on other machines with minor or no modification.
* C is a collection of C library functions; we can also create our function and add it to the C library.
* C is easily extensible.
## Advantages of C
* C is the building block for many other programming languages.
* Programs written in C are highly portable.
* Several standard functions are there (like in-built) that can be used to develop programs.
* C programs are collections of C library functions, and it's also easy to add own functions to the C library.
* The modular structure makes code debugging, maintenance and testing easier.

## Disadvantages of C
* C does not provide Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
* There are no concepts of Namespace in C.
* C does not provide binding or wrapping up of data in a single unit.
* C does not provide Constructor and Destructor.
