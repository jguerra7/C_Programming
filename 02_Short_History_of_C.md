C is imperative language and designed to compile in a relatively straightforward manner which provides low-level access to the memory. With the gradual increase in the popularity of the program, the language and its compiler have become available on a wide range of platforms from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers.
With the introduction of K&R C language (which is a new edition of C published in 1978 by Brian Kernighan and Denis Ritchie), several features have been included in C language.

### Some of these features are:

* Standard I/O (Input/Output) Library
* long int - data type
* unsigned int - data type
* Compound assignment operators

During the late 1980s, C was started to use for a wide variety of mainframe computers, micro and mini computers which began to get famous. Gradually C got its superset - i.e., C++ which has added features, but its developed from C with all its initial concepts.
```
* C is a by-product of UNIX, developed at Bell Laboratories by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others. 
* Thompson designed a small language named B.
* B was based on BCPL, a systems programming language developed in the mid-1960s.
```
## Origins of C
* By 1971, Ritchie began to develop an extended version of B.
* He called his language NB (“New B”) at first.
* As the language began to diverge more from B, he changed its name to C.
* The language was stable enough by 1973 that UNIX could be rewritten in C.
## Standardization of C
* K&R C
  * Described in Kernighan and Ritchie, The C Programming Language (1978)
  * De facto standard
* C89/C90
  * ANSI standard X3.159-1989 (completed in 1988; formally approved in December 1989)
  * International standard ISO/IEC 9899:1990
* C99
  * International standard ISO/IEC 9899:1999
  * Incorporates changes from Amendment 1 (1995)

## C-Based Languages
* C++ includes all the features of C, but adds classes and other features to support object-oriented programming.
* Java is based on C++ and therefore inherits many C features.
* C# is a more recent language derived from C++ and Java.
* Perl has adopted many of the features of C.

## Properties of C
* Low-level
* Small 
* Permissive
## Strengths of C
* Efficiency
* Portability
* Power
* Flexibility
* Standard library
* Integration with UNIX
## Weaknesses of C
* Programs can be error-prone. 
* Programs can be difficult to understand. 
* Programs can be difficult to modify.
## Effective Use of C
* Learn how to avoid pitfalls.
* Use software tools (lint, debuggers) to make programs more reliable. 
* Take advantage of existing code libraries.
* Adopt a sensible set of coding conventions.
* Avoid “tricks” and overly complex code.
* Stick to the standard.
