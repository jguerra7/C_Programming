# C DATA TYPES
In C programming, data types are declarations for variables. This determines the type and size of data associated with variables. For example,
```c
int myVar;
```
Here, myVar is a variable of int (integer) type. The size of int is 4 bytes.

## Basic types
Here's a table containing commonly used types in C programming for quick access.
```
Type	              Size (bytes)	               Format Specifier
int	              at least 2, usually 4             	%d
char	                   1	                         %c
float                   	4	                          %f
double                	8                             	%lf
short int             	2 usually                  	%hd
unsigned int	        at least 2, usually 4             %u
long int	            at least 4, usually 8         	%li
long long int	         at least 8	                    %lli
unsigned long int	      at least 4	                  %lu
unsigned long long int	  at least 8	                %llu
signed char	                1                         	%c
unsigned char	              1	                          %c
long double	            at least 10, usually 12 or 16	  %Lf
```
## int
Integers are whole numbers that can have both zero, positive and negative values but no decimal values. For example, 0, -5, 10

We can use int for declaring an integer variable.
```c
int id;
```
Here, id is a variable of type integer.

You can declare multiple variables at once in C programming. For example,
```c
int id, age;
```
The size of int is usually 4 bytes (32 bits). And, it can take 232 distinct states from -2147483648 to 2147483647.

## float and double
float and double are used to hold real numbers.
```c
float salary;
double price;
```
In C, floating-point numbers can also be represented in exponential. For example,
```c
float normalizationFactor = 22.442e2;
```
What's the difference between float and double?

The size of float (single precision float data type) is 4 bytes. And the size of double (double precision float data type) is 8 bytes.

## char
Keyword char is used for declaring character type variables. For example,
```c
char test = 'h';
```
The size of the character variable is 1 byte.

## void
void is an incomplete type. It means "nothing" or "no type". You can think of void as absent.

For example, if a function is not returning anything, its return type should be void.

Note that, you cannot create variables of void type.

## short and long
If you need to use a large number, you can use a type specifier long. Here's how:
```c
long a;
long long b;
long double c;
```
Here variables a and b can store integer values. And, c can store a floating-point number.

If you are sure, only a small integer ([âˆ’32,767, +32,767] range) will be used, you can use short.
```c
short d;
```
You can always check the size of a variable using the sizeof() operator.
```c
#include <stdio.h>      
int main() {
  short a;
  long b;
  long long c;
  long double d;
  printf("size of short = %d bytes\n", sizeof(a));
  printf("size of long = %d bytes\n", sizeof(b));
  printf("size of long long = %d bytes\n", sizeof(c));
  printf("size of long double= %d bytes\n", sizeof(d));
  return 0;
}
```
## signed and unsigned
In C, signed and unsigned are type modifiers. You can alter the data storage of a data type by using them. For example,
```c
unsigned int x;
int y;
```
Here, the variable x can hold only zero and positive values because we have used the unsigned modifier.

Considering the size of int is 4 bytes, variable y can hold values from -231 to 231-1, whereas variable x can hold values from 0 to 232-1.

Other data types defined in C programming are:
```
bool Type
Enumerated type
Complex types
```
## Derived Data Types
Data types that are derived from fundamental data types are derived types. For example: arrays, pointers, function types, structures, etc.
We will learn about these derived data types in later sections.

# C Programming Operators
An operator is a symbol that operates on a value or a variable. For example: + is an operator to perform addition.

C has a wide range of operators to perform various operations.

## C Arithmetic Operators
An arithmetic operator performs mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc on numerical values (constants and variables).
```
Operator	   Meaning of Operator
+          	addition or unary plus
-	          subtraction or unary minus
*           	multiplication
/           	division
%         	remainder after division (modulo division)
```
Example 1: Arithmetic Operators
```c
// Working of arithmetic operators
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 9,b = 4, c;
    
    c = a+b;
    printf("a+b = %d \n",c);
    c = a-b;
    printf("a-b = %d \n",c);
    c = a*b;
    printf("a*b = %d \n",c);
    c = a/b;
    printf("a/b = %d \n",c);
    c = a%b;
    printf("Remainder when a divided by b = %d \n",c);
    
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
a+b = 13
a-b = 5
a*b = 36
a/b = 2
Remainder when a divided by b=1
```
The operators +, - and * computes addition, subtraction, and multiplication respectively as you might have expected.

In normal calculation, 9/4 = 2.25. However, the output is 2 in the program.

It is because both the variables a and b are integers. Hence, the output is also an integer. The compiler neglects the term after the decimal point and shows answer 2 instead of 2.25.

The modulo operator % computes the remainder. When a=9 is divided by b=4, the remainder is 1. The % operator can only be used with integers.

Suppose a = 5.0, b = 2.0, c = 5 and d = 2. Then in C programming,
```
// Either one of the operands is a floating-point number
a/b = 2.5  
a/d = 2.5  
c/b = 2.5  

// Both operands are integers
c/d = 2
```
##  C Increment and Decrement Operators
C programming has two operators increment ++ and decrement -- to change the value of an operand (constant or variable) by 1.

Increment ++ increases the value by 1 whereas decrement -- decreases the value by 1. These two operators are unary operators, meaning they only operate on a single operand.

Example 2: Increment and Decrement Operators
```c
// Working of increment and decrement operators
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 10, b = 100;
    float c = 10.5, d = 100.5;
    printf("++a = %d \n", ++a);
    printf("--b = %d \n", --b);
    printf("++c = %f \n", ++c);
    printf("--d = %f \n", --d);
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
++a = 11
--b = 99
++c = 11.500000
++d = 99.500000
```
Here, the operators ++ and -- are used as prefixes. These two operators can also be used as postfixes like a++ and a--. 

## C Assignment Operators
An assignment operator is used for assigning a value to a variable. The most common assignment operator is =
```
Operator	Example	    Same as
=	      a = b	        a = b
+=	    a += b      	a = a+b
-=    	a -= b      	a = a-b
*=    	a *= b      	a = a*b
/=	    a /= b      	a = a/b
%=	    a %= b      	a = a%b
```
Example 3: Assignment Operators
```C
// Working of assignment operators
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 5, c;
    c = a;      // c is 5
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c += a;     // c is 10 
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c -= a;     // c is 5
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c *= a;     // c is 25
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c /= a;     // c is 5
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c %= a;     // c = 0
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
c = 5 
c = 10 
c = 5 
c = 25 
c = 5 
c = 0
```
## C Relational Operators
A relational operator checks the relationship between two operands. If the relation is true, it returns 1; if the relation is false, it returns value 0.

Relational operators are used in decision making and loops.
```
Operator	        Meaning of Operator	            Example
==	              Equal to	                      5 == 3 is evaluated to 0
>	                Greater than	                  5 > 3 is evaluated to 1
<	                Less than	                      5 < 3 is evaluated to 0
!=	              Not equal to                  	5 != 3 is evaluated to 1
>=	              Greater than or equal to	      5 >= 3 is evaluated to 1
<=	               Less than or equal to	        5 <= 3 is evaluated to 0
```
Example 4: Relational Operators
```c
// Working of relational operators
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 5, b = 5, c = 10;
    printf("%d == %d is %d \n", a, b, a == b);
    printf("%d == %d is %d \n", a, c, a == c);
    printf("%d > %d is %d \n", a, b, a > b);
    printf("%d > %d is %d \n", a, c, a > c);
    printf("%d < %d is %d \n", a, b, a < b);
    printf("%d < %d is %d \n", a, c, a < c);
    printf("%d != %d is %d \n", a, b, a != b);
    printf("%d != %d is %d \n", a, c, a != c);
    printf("%d >= %d is %d \n", a, b, a >= b);
    printf("%d >= %d is %d \n", a, c, a >= c);
    printf("%d <= %d is %d \n", a, b, a <= b);
    printf("%d <= %d is %d \n", a, c, a <= c);
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
5 == 5 is 1
5 == 10 is 0
5 > 5 is 0
5 > 10 is 0
5 < 5 is 0
5 < 10 is 1
5 != 5 is 0
5 != 10 is 1
5 >= 5 is 1
5 >= 10 is 0
5 <= 5 is 1
5 <= 10 is 1 
```
## C Logical Operators
An expression containing logical operator returns either 0 or 1 depending upon whether expression results true or false. Logical operators are commonly used in decision making in C programming.
```
Operator	    Meaning	                                         Example

&&	    Logical AND. True only if all operands are true     	If c = 5 and d = 2 then, expression ((c==5) && (d>5)) equals to 0.
||	    Logical OR. True only if either one operand is true	  If c = 5 and d = 2 then, expression ((c==5) || (d>5)) equals to 1.
!     	Logical NOT. True only if the operand is 0           	If c = 5 then, expression !(c==5) equals to 0.
```
Example 5: Logical Operators
```c
// Working of logical operators
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 5, b = 5, c = 10, result;
    result = (a == b) && (c > b);
    printf("(a == b) && (c > b) is %d \n", result);
    result = (a == b) && (c < b);
    printf("(a == b) && (c < b) is %d \n", result);
    result = (a == b) || (c < b);
    printf("(a == b) || (c < b) is %d \n", result);
    result = (a != b) || (c < b);
    printf("(a != b) || (c < b) is %d \n", result);
    result = !(a != b);
    printf("!(a == b) is %d \n", result);
    result = !(a == b);
    printf("!(a == b) is %d \n", result);
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
(a == b) && (c > b) is 1 
(a == b) && (c < b) is 0 
(a == b) || (c < b) is 1 
(a != b) || (c < b) is 0 
!(a != b) is 1 
!(a == b) is 0 
```
Explanation of logical operator program
```
(a == b) && (c > 5) evaluates to 1 because both operands (a == b) and (c > b) is 1 (true).
(a == b) && (c < b) evaluates to 0 because operand (c < b) is 0 (false).
(a == b) || (c < b) evaluates to 1 because (a = b) is 1 (true).
(a != b) || (c < b) evaluates to 0 because both operand (a != b) and (c < b) are 0 (false).
!(a != b) evaluates to 1 because operand (a != b) is 0 (false). Hence, !(a != b) is 1 (true).
!(a == b) evaluates to 0 because (a == b) is 1 (true). Hence, !(a == b) is 0 (false).
```
## C Bitwise Operators
During computation, mathematical operations like: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc are converted to bit-level which makes processing faster and saves power.

Bitwise operators are used in C programming to perform bit-level operations.
```
Operators	              Meaning of operators
&	                      Bitwise AND
|                     	Bitwise OR
^                     	Bitwise exclusive OR
~	                      Bitwise complement
<<	                    Shift left
>>                    	Shift right
```

## Other Operators
## Comma Operator
Comma operators are used to link related expressions together. For example:
```c
int a, c = 5, d;
```
## The sizeof operator
The sizeof is a unary operator that returns the size of data (constants, variables, array, structure, etc).

Example 6: sizeof Operator
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a;
    float b;
    double c;
    char d;
    printf("Size of int=%lu bytes\n",sizeof(a));
    printf("Size of float=%lu bytes\n",sizeof(b));
    printf("Size of double=%lu bytes\n",sizeof(c));
    printf("Size of char=%lu byte\n",sizeof(d));
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
Size of int = 4 bytes
Size of float = 4 bytes
Size of double = 8 bytes
Size of char = 1 byte
```
Other operators such as ternary operator ?:, reference operator &, dereference operator * and member selection operator -> will be discussed in later sections.
